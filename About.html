                    With over 25 years of experience in deep-space logistics, starship engineering, 
                    and orbital fleet operations, Kara Thrace founded SPEAR with a singular belief:
                    to redefine the standards of spacecraft manufacturing.
                    A respected engineer known for her precision, calm leadership, and relentless 
                    pursuit of excellence, Kara spent decades working on high-profile shipbuilding 
                    projects across the inner systems. Her expertise in structural refinement and 
                    propulsion efficiency became the backbone of SPEAR’s manufacturing philosophy.
                    Under her guidance, SPEAR has grown from a small orbital workshop into one of the 
                    most trusted names in starship manufacturing, known for engineering ships that are 
                    reliable, elegant, and built for the long haul.

                <p class="about_text">
                    SPEAR began as a small orbital engineering team working within a modest shipyard suspended above Ganymede. 
                    In those early years, Kara Thrace and her crew focused on crafting personal and mid-size ships that prioritized 
                    reliability and pilot comfort. While other manufacturers chased mass production, SPEAR invested in refinement:
                    stronger hulls, smarter systems, more customizable interiors, and intuitive navigation technologies.
                    Word spread quickly. Pilots trusted our ships not because they were flashy, but because they were dependable.
                    Over time, SPEAR expanded into a sprawling orbital shipyard complex with the capability to design, assemble, 
                    and test a full range of vessels—from personal transports to advanced long-range cruisers. Every ship that leaves 
                    our platforms still carries that same core promise: built with care, tested with integrity, and refined for the journey ahead.
